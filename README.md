## Important Links
* [Class' Slack channel](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/CEEUKP4KH)
* [SEI-1 Gitbook 2019](https://wdi-sg.github.io/gitbook-2019/)

## Important Policies

Please read and adhere to the following, otherwise bad things might happen:

### Prework
You should have completed the following in preparation for the course:

* [GA Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/)
* [WDI Fundamentals](http://fundamentals.generalassemb.ly/)
* [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)

This is to ensure that you can handle the pace of the class.

### Attendance
Our attendance policy for graduation is no more than 4 absences during the course. 15 minutes late = 1 tardy. 3 tardies = 1 absence.

If you know you'll be late or absent, please let us know and we'll arrange to have your tardy or absence excused.

### Practice Work and Projects
**Homework:** Pull requests have to be submitted by 9am the next day regardless of completion status.

**Projects:** Everyone should complete the minimum requirements for each project in order for this course to be considered completed.

**Submissions:** Via github [pull request.](https://wdi-sg.github.io/gitbook-2019/01-workflow/how-to-practice.html)

### Project Presentation Format
At the end of project week, all students will have the opportunity to share their hard work with the rest of the class (fun!).
There will be 2 parts to project presentation day:
  * __Individual Project Presentations__
    * Every student gets __5 minutes__ to _demo_ her/his project to the class. Show the product, not talk about specific parts of code, unless it's something really interesting! If you are not presenting, note down questions/comments you have for the presenter because later on, you'll be able to ask/tell them...

  * __Post-Mortems (After Project Presentations)__
    * We do 1-on-1 project post-mortems with all students. Read details about [post-mortem format](project-1/project-post-mortem.md) (note: you'll need to prepare for it).
